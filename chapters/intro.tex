\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}
Serverless or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a new generation of cloud based architecture that have arisen in the later years \cite{serverless_impact, serverless_computing_current_trends}. The architecture is fully dependent on cloud infrastructure and promises reduced operational cost, green computing, simpler development and more \cite{martin_fowler_serverless}. The difference between FaaS and more traditional cloud architectures is that the functionality of an application is split into small independent, autonomous and stateless functions \cite{serverless_computing_current_trends}. Instances of these functions are created when the function is called or activated by a trigger, such as as a database change. After a function has finish executing, the instance is then shut down, freeing server resources and potentially reducing infrastructure cost \cite{cost_comparison_of_running_monolithic_microservice_AWS_lambda}. Right now there are several cloud providers that offer serverless functionality such as Amazon through \textit{AWS Lambda}, Google through \textit{Cloud Functions} and Microsoft through \textit{Azure functions} \cite{serverless_impact}. 

While this new trend in software development offer significant benefits it does not come without its drawbacks. 

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}



(Since this is an emerging approach to software development and software architecture I think there would be value in researching the serverless or FaaS approach further. )



\section{Aim}
\label{sec:aim}
The aim of this study is to explore the serverless architecture...
